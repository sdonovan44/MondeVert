I understand that we may not be the closest of friends, but I wanted to reach out to you during this difficult time. 
Life can be completely unfair and frustrating, but I am confident that you will come out stronger in the long run, I am proud of you for your sobriety and I really want to acknowledge your courage to deal with such a devistating event. 
Please know that your friends and family are here to support you, and I am also here for you if you need anything. 
I am truly sorry for your loss, and my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. 

Sincerely,

This is an amazing offer for only $1.33 a month, at just under $16 bucks for the year it's super affordable and worth the buy. 

This is a lifetime rate I will offer for my first 10,000 subscribers. Don't miss out as once I hit 10,000 the price will raise and the amount of benefits will decrease! Who is going to be my ride or die? 

I understand $16 adds up and no one can afford to subscribe to everyone that interests them, I promise you will not regret subscribing to MondeVert because the Quantity and the Quality of the content I am producing will far outweigh the ^16 a year purchase. I am not greedy but I would love to transition into this type of work full time and your subscriptions will allow me to do that. I am hoping you think my content is worth the price. 


What I offer:  I have a plethora of written materials, audiobooks, Digital Art, rough music production, Trivia ,movies and other video production content I will be posting on this site for all to enjoy. No doubt a lot of this will end up on youtube, but this subscription gets many additional features and benefits like early access and other ways to interact with me directly. Because my business is so spread out, this will be a great place for me to centralize my content and also give a full view into my projects. This does mean some audiences need to be careful as I will have content ranging from Children's books to NSFW Screenplays and other content. I leave it to a parent to pull the information from here and then share with your child, or point them to one of MondeVert's Children Friendly Youtube channels. I will do my best to separate the content so its easy to stay in the Family Friendly Content vs the more edgy and adult focued material. 


I am working with local artists and writers and want to connect with independent freelancers accross the globe to help them improve their ability to reach an audience and also to appreciate the great work they are doing. Among many other publications, I will try to have written/video submissions for a range of topics and criteria with a payout structure to benefit all that submit. In some cases there will be no fee and in other cases there will be a small fee to fund the Winning pool and help pay for judges etc.



Note: I am able to create so much content with the help of my AI tool - SHAINE. I am working with partners with openAI/ChatGPT (software). A lot of the work is still human, but working with AI helps me create more effective and without needing to edit my words and grammar for hours. In the future I plan on making this tool available for people to use as a service, in the near future I hope to release a beta of the app where my subscribers will get free uses each month to try out the tool!

Thanks for your interest, I hope you can subscribe and I look forward to interacting in the future with you!
