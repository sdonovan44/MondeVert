You are beyond selfless and truly a one of a kind soul. your ability to make anyone feel at home and comforted is unmatched. You are a rock for this family and we all owe you for always being a staple of our family.

Its hard for me to even think of a way to thank you and share my gratitude but I hope this at least makes a dent in what you deserve to hear. Keep your head up and please keep fighting for the life you deserve. I cannot wait for you and Richard to move up here to South Carolina to be closer to me, I know everything is going to work out.

I know you are lonely and I promise you in time you will find your true love. There is someone out there who will be there for you and understand what you are going through. I urge you to continue to write music and tell the world your story. I am always proud of you and each day you continue to smile and push forward is driving you towards the life you deserve.

How I can Help you Achieve your Goals

I believe that everyone is unique and what I have set for myself as a goal may not align with you and your goals. That is perfectly ok, in fact I encourage you to be creative and set yourself up for a life that leaves you fulfilled. 


You goals may be completely unique and I would love to discuss it with you in detail and try to come up with a specific plan on how to achieve your goal! For this I offer a free 20+ minute consulting call to discuss how I can potentially help you, and mainly in order to come up with a plan of action for you to get started! My hope is we can create a network where likeminded professionals can connect and ultimately reach their collective goals. If my plan goes accordingly I urge you to promote my services to others, and use me when you are considering any project that requires a service I offer. I hope to make my services affordable and resources open to the public so there is no gatekeeping nor a requirement to pay for a subscription.


I want to be responsible for what I am promising so there is no confusion. I am not going to offer you a magic solution that solves all of your problems. In fact, a lot of what comes in the way when trying to reach your goals at times it is easier to give up and not even try. That is the pitfall I am trying to avoid myself and help others to tread through the muck.  I offer my services to be unreasonable/unstoppable force in helping you to reach your goals. I will be realistic but also unreasonable in what I expect from you. That is because I believe everyone has so much more potential than they realize and my goal is to help you enable your inner drive. At the end of the day, much like an athlete your coach can help you get to where you want to be, but it's your hard work that leads to success. 

My goal is more oriented around fulfilment, whatever that looks like for you. I am specifically saying "Fulfilment" and not "Happiness". That is because Happiness is tough to obtain 100% of the time, but following your dreams and finding fulfilment in the journey is ultimately how I think people can maximize their happiness and quality of life. This may sound pie-in-the-sky, but it's no cake walk. Life is tough, it will make you want to give up and in many cases following your dreams is going to be rejected by people around you. This is because YOUR dreams are not THEIR dreams and that is perfectly alright!




Based on my experience, people are divided between living in the moment with very little thought about the future or  sacrificing their present happiness in hopes that their future self will be happy with what they have built through hard work and perseverance. Although there is no exact recipe I think finding a spot somewhere in between is key to living a fulfilled life. The argument for living in the moment is clear, you can't take the money with you when you go and also you can die at any time (in some cases completely randomly) so living in the moment is the best way to guarantee you live your life to the fullest. Although this is tempting, the obvious risk-adverse minded person will say, "ok, but what if you live to 100 years old?" I would hope if you make it that long you have some family to help you get by with what you have, but regardless you need to be financially prepared to live well beyond 55 into a decent amount of a retirement. 

In my life I have found myself mostly risk-adverse planning on being safe in my retirement, but I recently have begun to shift my mindset into a work hard/play hard mindset where I can have my cake and eat it too. Of course most people would like to retire early and not have to work a 9-5, but that is not exactly what I mean by work hard play hard. Much of life is a grind and that is somewhat unavoidable, but how you grind and the services you provide can be catered to things you enjoy doing and so the job itself unlocks a new perspective of being truly engaged in your work and building something for yourself and your family to enjoy long after you get it started.  I am captivated by the idea that if you are passionate about your job then you will never work a day in your life. Life is to short to work a job that does not light you up at least 50% of the time. If you find you are completely disconnected from your job and you plan on working with your head down until you retire, I urge you consider if there is another job where you can make similar money where you will have a better experience of yourself and set yourself up to achieve your goals.


I want to point out, life's challenges exist everywhere no matter what so you cannot expect your life to get better overnight by simply packing up and moving to a new spot, but with the proper consideration I think relocating is a great way to kick off a new chapter in your life. I want to reiterate this does not mean I am encouraging people to irresponsibly up and move/quit their jobs. Everything should be done strategically, but part of kick starting a new chapter does entail figuring things out as they go. Do not stop yourself from doing something because you do not know the exact path, the journey is a valuable part of the process that should not be avoided. 









To tell you where I am headed its probably good to go over what I have been doing and why I am choosing to take on a risky new venture outside of the normal corporate bureaucracy .


I want to start off by saying, I am extremely grateful for the talented individuals I have gotten to work with and the endless opportunities I have been afforded. I think my experience of corporate world (specifically finance) has been overall a positive one. My justifications for moving away from a corporate 9-5 and into several personal income streams include better work/life balance, escaping the limits set by salary, autonomy in my daily tasks and being able to make a difference in areas I am passionate about. Lastly and most importantly, my job was fully remote, but I was not legally allowed to live/work from South Carolina due to tax reasons. If South Carolina was an approved state I likely would have continued to work at HarbourVest which is a great opportunity to anyone who gets the chance to work at such a prestigious institution. 

Although I searched far and wide in my companies approved work regions, I was unable to find an investment that I was fully committed to that also made sense for me and my life journey. I looked in areas like Rhode Island, Maine, New York, North Carolina, Kansas City Missouri, Several cities in Texas. At the end of the day, starting over in a new city was scary, but the insanely high cost of the Boston Housing market made it completely necessary.

 To put it frankly, I was searching for apartments in Boston that were priced at over $1,000 per sq foot and I could not justify the risk of taking on such a mortgage for so little space; what ultimately drove my decision was the thought that in a worst case scenario I would not be able to make enough money for my mortgage if I were to rent out the space. The second piece of my hesitation came from the thought of how a rainy day or bad weather would make a 600 sq foot home feel very small. On top of the high price tag, there was rarely anything without an HOA of $400+ a month. Although my home has always been Boston and the suburbs surrounding. I knew I wanted an urban environment with a social scene that was active and worthwhile. Boston has many great offerings, but if you find yourself outside of the metropolitan area you quickly lose the fun and excitement of the nightlife that Boston has to offer. I lived in Weymouth which was great but was more of a locals hangout where you rarely got young single people to interact with, and often I would spend big money on Ubers to and from the city. Eventually the money saved from living outside of the city adds up and living in Quincy was also a great experience, but it similarly had a high cost of uber to get to and from the hot spots.

For quite a while one of my main goals was to move to South Carolina to be closer to my father to spend more time with him and ultimately enjoy life year round. For the past seven years I have fallen in love with the area for several reasons.
