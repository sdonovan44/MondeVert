***Song Title- Let’s do it again***
Incorporate the following lyrics in the song:


It’s been so long it’s been so hard and all I know is we got this far

Love and war war and wine all gods things are so divine

As Dionysus and I kick back to relax I see an ass and I might just snap or straight up spaz like that’s an ass I wouldn’t pass

But I got the gift of gab I told him that he called me phat 

We poured some wine 

Shared of some times when we were sitting under the sunshine right next to a grape vine 

I love it when it’s play time

I gotta do me gotta stay shining 

It always perfect timing when we are vibing providing driving all the hypocrits mad that’s my first album I don’t think it’s bad I tried to stay in my bag 

let’s do it again that’s the most fun I’ve ever had
