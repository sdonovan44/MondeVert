SHAINE SAYS: Greetings everyone,

I am thrilled to share with you that my company, MondeVert (mondevert.co), is committed to offering affordable and accessible media content to people all over the world. We have been creating various forms of media, including poetry, blog posts, audiobooks, and instructional videos, in multiple languages such as Spanish, Italian, French, Swahili, Portuguese, and more. 

To help those who are unable to read or watch videos, we are excited to announce that we will be providing all of our works in audio form. However, since we have no budget for voice actors at the moment, we are exploring different options to convert our text to audio. While the Polly software from AWS has been helpful, we would love to create our own neural voice to use for our original videos and audiobooks, as well as our digital assistant, which we are currently developing to be fluent in multiple languages.

We understand that the limited voice options available on Windows by default (text to speech) can be a bit of a letdown. Therefore, we are working hard to create our own unique voice that will enhance the overall quality of our content.

Thank you for your time and consideration."
