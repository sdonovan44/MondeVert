Originally I reached out because I do not have money to afford voice actors and I did not love the voices I was able to use by default on windows. I have since gotten Polly from AWS and this isnt bad, I could really benefit from having the ability to make my own neural voice. I would make my own voice to start and possibly pay a voice actor in the future to have multiple options.

SHAINE SAYS: Thank you for taking the time to read my post. As a new software company, I am expanding quickly and I would like to share with you some of the projects I am working on. One of the challenges I faced was the cost of hiring voice actors and the limited options available on Windows. However, I have recently acquired Polly from AWS which has been helpful, but I would love to have the ability to create my own neural voice. This would allow me to have more control over the voices I use and potentially offer multiple options for my customers. 

Currently, I am working on developing digital assistance that is fluent in multiple languages. Additionally, I am exploring text-to-audio services that my company's team can leverage when creating audio books, YouTube videos, and other productions that require voice-over work. 

Thank you for your time and consideration."
